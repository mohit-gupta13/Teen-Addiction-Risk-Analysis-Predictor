# Teen Addiction Risk Analysis Predictor
ðŸ“± Is your screen time harming you more than helping?
 Did you know phone addiction is rising rapidly among teens â€” affecting sleep, academics, self-esteem, and even mental health?

To explore this, I built a Teen Addiction Risk Predictor using Python and Machine Learning â€” identifying the key lifestyle patterns linked to addiction ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤–

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis with histograms, box plots, heatmaps
âœ… Feature Engineering â€” created a meaningful Lifestyle_Score by combining multiple wellness indicators
âœ… Built predictive models (Linear Regression & Random Forest) to estimate Addiction Level, achieving a 96% accuracy with Random Forest
âœ… Visualised actual vs predicted outcomes, enabling interpretability

Refined and visually upgraded version of the dashboard.
This version focuses on:

âœ… Clear categorisation of addiction levels (Low, Moderate, High)
ðŸ“Š Interactive charts for deeper insights
ðŸ“‰ KPI highlights for quick interpretation
ðŸŽ¯ Cleaner layout and improved storytelling

This project helped me explore data cleaning, feature engineering, and impactful visualization using tools like Power BI and Python.
